# Skribbl.io Server

Welcome to the **Skribbl.io Server** project! This is a custom server designed to replicate the functionality of a Skribbl.io game server, built for fun and learning purposes.

> **Note**: This project is a work in progress and currently lacks some features. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## How to Use

Follow these steps to set up and run the server:

1. **Install Node.js**  
   - Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended) if you haven't already.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Run the provided `install.bat` script to install all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     install.bat
     ```

3. **Start the Server**  
   - Run the `run.bat` script to launch the server:
     ```bash
     run.bat
     ```

## Current Status

This project is still under development. Many features are missing, and it may not fully replicate the Skribbl.io experience yet. Stay tuned for updates, or feel free to contribute to help complete the project!
